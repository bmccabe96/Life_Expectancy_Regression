# Life_Expectancy_Regression 

This project presents an analysis of life expectancy using a dataset containing heatlh data collected from World Health Organization (WHO) and economic data collected from the Unite Nations (UN). This data was compiled by Kumar Rajarshi and posted to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). We (Brian McCabe and Italo Calderon) attempt to conduct a regression analysis to give insight to country leaders on how to increase the life expectancy of their populace.

In this repository there are three notebooks:
  * **life_expectancy_cleaning**: This notebook details the data cleaning process.
  * **life_expectancy_eda**: This notebook contains our initial data exploration and hypothesis tests that informed our creation of our regression. 
  * **regression_model**: This notebook walks through our regression analysis, including the training process for 7 models.
